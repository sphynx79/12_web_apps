  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load elasticsearch now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml

    = simple_form_for(@user, html: { class: 'form-horizontal' }) do |form|
